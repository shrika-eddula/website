      Hi! I'm a junior at MIT studying CS + AI, Chemistry, and Business. In a previous life, I was building software at Apple on the Vision Products team and autonomous drone systems at the US Army.

      I dabble in research when I can. I'm a Barry M. Goldwater Scholar and have published 12 papers in international peer-reviewed journals. While my research interests are field agnostic, I enjoy analytical chemistry, affective computing, and embedded systems.

      Long term, I have a couple of delusional goals such as accelerating artifical photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. I'd like to solve climate change in my lifetime. But at present, I'm building robots ðŸ¦¾ and software ðŸ§ª for the life sciences ðŸ”¬ and making biochemical synthesis 10 times faster.

      If any of my yapping interests you, please do drop me a note!
